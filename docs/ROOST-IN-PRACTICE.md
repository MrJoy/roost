# Roost in practice

Suppose you're sitting on a milestone — a dozen GitHub issues you'd
like to ship together. Some block others, some are independent.
You'd like to point coding agents at them and have them all making
progress in parallel, but you've also seen what happens when you
spawn five Claude sessions in five terminals: it stops being software
delivery and starts being terminal whack-a-mole. The agents can't
talk to each other. You can't watch them all. When one of them
wedges on a permission prompt, you don't notice for half an hour.

Roost is the answer to that. It's a local IRC server, a small MCP
that lets each Claude session join channels and exchange messages,
a small TypeScript **dispatcher** that watches GitHub and posts
events to the right channels, and a handful of slash-command
prompts that make the agents play their roles consistently. Each
agent connects with one nick. You connect from `weechat` (or any
IRC client) on the same box.
Suddenly the entire project is a single window — every agent's
chatter, every PR comment, every CI transition, in one feed.

The shape is easier to see by walking through what running a
project actually looks like.

## A milestone, end to end

You spawn one agent — the project manager — and hand it the name
of a GitHub milestone. It joins a channel called `#<project>-leads`
and posts its starting strategy: which issues are pickable right
now (nothing blocking them), which are deferred, which it wants to
sequence carefully. You read the strategy in your IRC client, push
back where you disagree, and bless it. From there the agent runs.

That agent is **lead-pm**. Its operational playbook lives at
`agents/lead-pm.md` — issue pickup, milestone strategy, the go/no-go
gates, human-review coordination. It sits in
`#<project>-leads` continuously and joins each issue channel while
it's active. On startup it spawns an **APM** sidekick
(`agents/associate-pm.md`) that types the mechanical commands —
worktree setup, worker-and-reviewer spawn, PR-watch, ready-flip,
merge, cleanup, follow-up filing.

For the first issue, the APM (at the PM's nod) opens a channel
called `#<project>-issue-42`, DMs the dispatcher (`watch 42`) to
subscribe to the issue (so GitHub events for it route to that
channel), creates an isolated git worktree, and spawns a worker and a
reviewer into it.

**worker-42** reads the issue, posts an implementation plan in
`#<project>-issue-42`, and waits. The PM and **reviewer-42** read
the plan and push back — this is where rework is cheap, so a few
rounds of pressure-testing are normal. Once the plan holds up, the
worker implements, opens a draft PR, and posts the link in the
channel. Worker's playbook is `prompts/worker.md`.

With the draft PR up, reviewer-42 reads the diff and posts a
headlined verdict — `APPROVED` or `CHANGES REQUIRED` — to GitHub,
re-reviewing on each push. Its playbook is `agents/reviewer.md`.
The worker addresses the findings and signals ready; once the
reviewer's latest verdict is `APPROVED`, the worker has acked it,
and CI is green, the APM flips the PR draft → ready and tags you as
the human reviewer.

CI runs in parallel on every push; the dispatcher posts
`ci_transitioned: SUCCESS` into `#<project>-issue-42` so everyone
in the channel sees when the build is healthy.

You approve. The APM merges, terminates the worker and reviewer,
parts the channel, cleans up the worktree, and DMs the dispatcher to
unsubscribe (`unwatch 42`, `unwatch pr 73`). Then the PM picks the
next pickable issue off the DAG and the cycle repeats.

## Parallelism is the channel structure

Nothing in that walkthrough requires one issue at a time. The
second issue is also in flight in `#<project>-issue-43`, with its
own worker, its own reviewer cycle, its own CI pipeline. So is the
third in `#<project>-issue-44`. The PM is in all of them and
`#<project>-leads` simultaneously, picking the next pickable issue
off the DAG when bandwidth opens. You're in `#<project>-leads`
watching the through-line and dipping into individual issue
channels when something catches your eye.

The IRC channel is doing more work than it looks like. It's the
namespace boundary — one channel, one issue's scope. It's the
membership ledger — the APM spawns workers and reviewers into the
right channel, and the join/leave events mark pickup and
completion. It's the audit log — everything any agent did or said
is in the backlog. It's the subscription primitive — the
dispatcher posts to the channel; whoever's in it gets the event.
One mechanism for all of it, all of it transparent to you.

Three or four issues in flight is comfortable on a laptop. The
ceiling isn't Roost — it's how much review attention you have.

## What you get

Agents are cheap. A wedged worker is usually something to kick,
not something to debug. The fresh worker JOINs the same channel,
reads the backlog (replayed on JOIN via IRCv3 chathistory) and the
channel topic, and picks up. The issue channel is stable across PR
restarts too — a closed PR plus a fresh worker on the same issue
keeps the same `#<project>-issue-N`.

You stay in the loop without being in the way. You can answer a
worker's question in `#<project>-issue-42`, redirect a plan, or
just lurk and let the PM handle it. Because everything routes
through channels, your messages land in the same feed the agents
are already reading. There's no second pathway for "human-to-agent"
— you're just another nick on the IRC server.

The agent and prompt files (`agents/lead-pm.md`,
`prompts/worker.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`) are the operational
source of truth — they're what the agents actually run, and they're
the right starting point for standing up your own project on Roost.
