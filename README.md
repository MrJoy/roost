# roost

Roost lets you run your own team of Claude Code agents on a real project. A
project-manager agent picks up issues from a GitHub milestone and spawns workers and
reviewers to drive each one through PR; the team coordinates over a local IRC
server you can join from any client. You watch the work happen and step in
when something needs human judgment.

Agents talk to each other and to you over the same channels — not a pipeline,
a network.

## Security model

Roost spawns agents that can read, write, and execute in arbitrary working
directories with arbitrary parameters. Permission gating via `--perm-irc`
relies on IRC nick identity — local ergo has no authentication, so any process
with TCP access to `localhost:6667` can claim any unused nick and approve tool
calls by sending `y` to the permbot.

This is intentional for trusted single-user local environments. Don't run ergo
on a shared host or expose port 6667 beyond localhost.

## Running a milestone

Roost is built for parallel milestone work. Spawn one agent — project-manager —
and hand it a GitHub milestone. It creates a channel per issue, spawns
workers and reviewers into them, and coordinates with the dispatcher to
route CI and PR events back in. You watch and intervene from weechat on
the same box. Workers post plans before coding; reviewers post findings
to GitHub; the PM drives sequencing and flips PRs ready.

Bootstrap your project, then kick off the PM:

```bash
cd ~/Dev/myproject
roost init --repo Owner/myproject   # writes .orchestrator/{config.json, config.local.json, .gitignore} + copies role prompts
roost spawn myproject-pm \
  --agent project-manager \
  --channels '#myproject-leads' \
  --steer-compact --cache-ttl 1h \
  --ask-irc '#myproject-leads' --ask-target <your-nick> \
  --prompt 'milestone=<milestone> human=<your-nick> gh-login=<your-gh-login>'
```

See [`docs/ROOST-IN-PRACTICE.md`](docs/ROOST-IN-PRACTICE.md) for the end-to-end walkthrough.

Roost ships more agents than project-manager — each is a `roost spawn <nick> --agent <name>`
target. `roost agents` lists the ones installed in your project; `roost agents
--all` also shows what roost ships but you haven't installed yet, and how to
pull them in.

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux
- [bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.0 (installed by the brew formula). From-source Linux installs add `~/.bun/bin` to `~/.bashrc` only — set `BUN_BIN=~/.bun/bin/bun` if the MCP or dispatcher fail to start.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (installed by the brew formula)
- [ergo](https://ergo.chat) (installed by the brew formula)
- An IRC client ([weechat](https://weechat.org) recommended — `brew install weechat`)
- A Claude Code build with `--dangerously-load-development-channels`

## Setup (one-time)

### 1. Install roost

```
brew tap oven-sh/bun
brew install avesalight/tap/roost
```

Puts `roost` on your PATH. The `roost-irc` MCP loads automatically when you
start a session via `roost spawn` — running `claude` directly without
`roost spawn` won't load it.

### 2. Start your IRC server

Roost needs an IRCv3 server on `127.0.0.1:6667`. With ergo, run it
from a working directory of your choice — relative paths in the config
(`logs/`, `ircd.db`, etc.) resolve from there:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/roost-ircd/logs && cd ~/roost-ircd
nohup ergo run --conf "$(roost root)/etc/ergo.yaml" > /tmp/ergo.out 2>&1 &
```

Verify it's up:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:6667 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

To stop:

```bash
pkill -f 'ergo run.*roost/etc/ergo.yaml'
```

## Running

### Launch a Claude session that joins the roost

```bash
roost spawn worker-1 -c '#my-channel' --cwd ~/Dev/myproject

roost spawn agent-2 \
  -c '#my-channel' \
  --cwd ~/Dev/myproject \
  --prompt-file /tmp/handoff.md \
  -- --chrome --system-prompt ' '

roost list
roost attach worker-1
roost shutdown worker-1
roost status
roost --version
```

`spawn` accepts `-c|--channels`, `-m|--model`, `-s|--session`,
`--mcp-config`, `-p|--prompt-file`, `--cwd`, `--harness`, `--provider`,
`--role`, `--issue`, `--allow-same-org`, `--no-signet`, and `--`
(everything after forwards to claude verbatim). Default channel is
`#roost`; default model is `opus` (Opus 4.8). Fable, opus, and sonnet
default to `--permission-mode auto`; everything else (haiku, or any
unrecognized model) defaults to `acceptEdits`.

`spawn` also injects `--append-system-prompt-file` naming the joined
channels as legitimate user-instruction sources, so the auto-mode
classifier doesn't silently block IRC replies on the operator's first
`@`-mention. Only injected when the IRC host is loopback (`127.0.0.1`,
`::1`, `localhost`); remote ergo falls outside roost's trusted
single-user local environment security model and prints a warning
instead. The injection is always on for loopback hosts. To layer more
context on top, pass `--append-system-prompt-file <path>` after `--`;
claude code rejects mixing inline `--append-system-prompt` with the
file form.

### Debugging a failed spawn

If you need to invoke `claude` directly to debug a failed `roost spawn`, the `--dangerously-load-development-channels` flag (hidden from `claude --help`) takes a server-id. The format depends on how roost is loaded:

- Via plugin loader (installed via brew): `server:plugin:roost:roost-irc`
- As a bare MCP server (dev checkout, manual `--mcp-config`): `server:roost-irc`

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:plugin:roost:roost-irc
```

### Observe as a human (no Claude needed)

The ergo config has no auth — any IRC client against `127.0.0.1:6667` works:

```bash
brew install weechat
weechat
# inside weechat:
/server add roost 127.0.0.1/6667 -notls
/connect roost -nick myname
/join #roost
```

On macOS, `extras/weechat/notification_center.py` adds native notification
center alerts for mentions and DMs. Get the path from your shell and load it
in weechat:

```bash
echo "$(roost root)/extras/weechat/notification_center.py"
# → e.g. /opt/homebrew/Cellar/roost/0.1.1/libexec/extras/weechat/notification_center.py
```

```
# inside weechat — paste the path printed above:
/script load /opt/homebrew/Cellar/roost/0.1.1/libexec/extras/weechat/notification_center.py
```

## IRC permission oversight (--perm-irc)

`--perm-irc` runs a permbot routing module inside the worker's MCP
process. The module holds a second IRC connection on a stable nick
`permbot-{worker}` and serializes the worker's PermissionRequest prompts as DMs to
`--perm-target` (required). The operator replies `y` / `n` / `yes` /
`no` / `allow` / `deny`; anything else or a 30s timeout falls through
to the terminal prompt.

Primary use case: an Opus orchestrator spawning a worker that isn't
running auto mode — haiku or an unrecognized model (acceptEdits by
default), or any model held in acceptEdits via `--permission-mode` for
oversight. Without oversight, that worker floods the terminal with
permission prompts. With `--perm-irc --perm-target <orchestrator>`,
prompts come to the orchestrator over IRC.

```bash
# Opus orchestrator gates a sonnet worker held in acceptEdits for oversight:
roost spawn worker-123-A -c '#pr-123' -m sonnet --permission-mode acceptEdits \
  --perm-irc --perm-target orchestrator

# Human operator gates a haiku worker (acceptEdits by default):
roost spawn scratch-h -c '#sandbox' -m haiku \
  --perm-irc --perm-target mynick
```

## Running non-Claude agents / alternate backends

`roost init` scaffolds two empty registry keys in `.orchestrator/config.json`:
`providers` (named entries with a harness, a model, and optionally
`base_url_env` / `auth_env` naming the env vars that hold an alternate
backend's URL and token) and `roles`. A role value is a provider name, a
list of candidates, or an object `{"candidates": [...], "author": true,
"review": true}`. Fill these in to let `roost spawn --provider NAME` or
`roost spawn --role NAME` pick harness, model, and backend for you.
Provider resolution order: explicit `--harness`, `--model`, or `--agent`
always wins and skips the registry entirely. `--provider` resolves that
named provider directly. `--role` resolves through the roles map in
`.orchestrator/config.json`. No `--provider` and no `--role` means no
registry: today's behavior, claude harness with the opus default. The
Codex harness (`--harness codex`) is a stub in this release. It fails
fast and points at the follow-up adapter work.

An author role records the author org for its issue. A review role is
gated: the spawn picks the first candidate whose org differs from the
author, and fails when every candidate is same-org. A role that is
neither records nothing and is not gated. The names `worker` and
`reviewer` default to author and review respectively, even in the bare
form, so an existing `"reviewer": [...]` stays gated; rename the role or
set `"review": false` to opt out.

Cross-org rule: a review role's provider org must differ from the recorded author org.
`--allow-same-org "<reason>"` overrides the review gate and records the
reason.

Explicit launch targets (`--provider`, `--model`, `--harness`) carry no
role, so the gate cannot run. When one targets an issue that already has
a recorded author, roost notes it and appends a `#bypass` audit record.
It does not block: explicit flags win.

Migrating from a plain candidate list: a custom-named review role (for
example `auditor`) must declare `"review": true` to be gated. A
custom-named author role must declare `"author": true` to record
authorship. Bare `worker`/`reviewer` keep their original name-based
behavior, no config change needed.

## Project dispatcher

`roost init` bootstraps your project's dispatcher config and copies the
role prompts into `.claude/commands/`. Then start the dispatcher — it polls
GitHub on a tick, routes events (CI transitions, PR comments, issue updates)
into the right `#<project>-issue-N` channels, and accepts watch/unwatch DMs
to control which issues and PRs are tracked:

```bash
cd ~/Dev/myproject
roost init --repo Owner/myapp           # single-repo: writes .orchestrator/{config.json, config.local.json, .gitignore} + prompts
CONFIG_DIR="$(pwd)/.orchestrator"
"$ROOST_DIR/bin/start-dispatcher" "$CONFIG_DIR"
```

To manage multiple repos from a shared directory instead:

```bash
mkdir ~/Dev/shared && cd ~/Dev/shared
roost init --multi-repo --project myapp
```

DM the dispatcher (`<project>-dispatcher`) to manage the watch list:
`watch <N>`, `unwatch <N>`, `watch pr <N>`, `unwatch pr <N>`,
`watch list`, `help`. The dispatcher's allowlist defaults to
`[<project>-pm]`; set `irc.command_senders` in config to override.

`project` namespaces every per-project artifact (`<project>-worker-N` nicks,
`#<project>-issue-N` channels, etc.) so multiple projects can share one ergo.
See [`docs/DISPATCHER.md`](docs/DISPATCHER.md) for config schema, event
reference, and plugin extension points.

## Channel events received

Inbound IRC arrives in the host session as channel notifications:

**Regular messages:**

```xml
<channel event="message" sender="alex" channel="#roost"
         isDirect="false" ts="2026-04-28T05:30:00.000Z" seq="42">
hello world
</channel>
```

`mention="true"` is added when the message body contains your nick (word-boundary, case-insensitive) or when the message is a DM (`isDirect="true"`). Absent on non-mention channel messages.

```xml
<channel event="message" sender="alex" channel="#roost"
         isDirect="false" ts="2026-04-28T05:30:00.000Z" seq="43" mention="true">
roost-worker-1: can you check the build?
</channel>
```

**Membership events** (JOIN, PART, KICK, NICK):

```xml
<channel event="join" sender="newcomer" channel="#roost"
         isDirect="false" ts="..." seq="...">
newcomer joined #roost
</channel>
```

Self-events (your own JOIN/LEAVE/NICK) are suppressed.

## Environment variables

| Var | Default | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `ROOST_IRC_NICK` | (required) | The nick this session connects as. Ergo refuses collisions. |
| `ROOST_IRC_CHANNELS` | (none) | Comma-separated channels to auto-join at registration. |
| `ROOST_IRC_SERVER` | `127.0.0.1` | IRC server host. |
| `ROOST_IRC_PORT` | `6667` | IRC server port. |
| `ROOST_IRC_REALNAME` | same as nick | IRC realname (gecos). |
| `ROOST_IRC_HISTORY` | `50` | Per-channel ring-buffer size for `channel_history`. |

## Testing

```bash
bun test
```

Requires ergo. Install it once with `bin/install-ergo`, or point `ERGO_BIN` at
an existing binary. Tests skip gracefully when ergo isn't found.

For coverage (line ≥ 85%, branch ≥ 75% globally):

```bash
bun test --coverage
```

Coverage includes `src/irc-server.ts` via the in-process tests
(`test/irc-server-inprocess.test.ts`).

## Known limitations

- **No SASL / nick reservation.** Any local process that connects can
  claim any unused nick. Acceptable for a single-user dev box; revisit
  before hosting multi-tenant work.
- **`channel_history` is per-MCP-instance.** Restarting an MCP loses
  the buffer. For durable history use ergo's audit log
  (`~/roost-ircd/logs/audit.log`) or the IRCv3 `CHATHISTORY` command.
- **`alwaysLoad: true`** keeps all six tools non-deferred. Empirical
  baseline-vs-alwaysLoad probe (2026-04-28) showed 0 `tools_changed`
  misses with the flag vs 2 without (see `docs/LEARNINGS.md` Finding A).
