# roost — manage Claude sessions on the IRC roost

The `roost` command brings up, observes, and tears down Claude Code
sessions that join the local roost IRC server. Each session is a tmux
pane running `claude` with the `roost-irc` MCP loaded, joined to the
channels you specify. The wrapper hides the env-var dance, dev-channels
prompt dismissal, and tmux session naming convention.

## When to use

- The user asks to spawn or kill a roost agent / worker.
- The user references a roost claude, tmux claude, or IRC agent by
  nick or channel.
- You need to coordinate with another Claude session via shared
  channels and there's no peer present yet.
- The user says "tear down the test" / "clean up the sandbox" /
  "list what's running."

If the user is asking about roost the system (architecture, channel
topology, what roost *is*), point them at `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the
roost plugin root (`roost root` prints the path) — that's prose, not
a tool surface.

## Command surface

```bash
roost spawn <nick> [-c CHANS] [-m MODEL] [--agent NAME] [-s SESSION] [--mcp-config PATH] \
                   [--cwd PATH] [--prompt PROMPT] \
                   [--permission-mode MODE] [--cache-ttl 5m|1h] \
                   [--steer-compact] \
                   [--perm-irc --perm-target NICK] \
                   [--ask-irc CHANNEL --ask-target NICK] \
                   [--no-signet] \
                   [--harness claude|codex] [--provider NAME | --role NAME] \
                   [--issue N] [--allow-same-org "<reason>"]
roost agents [--all]
roost shutdown <nick>
roost list
roost attach <nick>
roost tail <nick> [-n LINES]
roost status
roost --version | -v
```

Defaults:

- channels: `#roost`
- model: `opus`
- permission mode: with `--agent`, the wrapper passes nothing and claude
  code reads `permissionMode:` natively from the agent frontmatter; with
  `--model` (or the default opus), the wrapper defaults to `auto` for fable,
  opus, and sonnet, `acceptEdits` for everything else (haiku, or any
  unrecognized model). Explicit `--permission-mode` wins in both paths.
- cache-ttl: no wrapper default — if unset, neither env var is
  injected and claude-code's native cache behavior applies. Caller
  picks per session. Translated to claude-code's env knobs in the
  spawned session: `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M=1` or
  `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1`. See `roost spawn --help`
  ("Agent class guidance") for the role→flag heuristic.
- cwd: current directory at spawn time
- session name: `roost-<nick>`
- mcp server: auto-loaded via plugin (override with `--mcp-config`)
- `--steer-compact`: opt-in. Wires a PreCompact hook that intercepts
  claude code's auto-compact and redirects it as a manual `/compact`
  with a directive (so the compactor runs with `custom_instructions`
  rather than its empty default). See `roost spawn --help`
  ("Agent class guidance") for which agents need this.
- A `.signet/` directory in the spawn cwd auto-activates signet-eval, a
  deterministic policy gate that runs ahead of the usual permission
  handling. `--no-signet` skips it even when `.signet/` is present.

The wrapper handles the `ROOST_IRC_*` env vars, the
`--dangerously-load-development-channels server:plugin:roost:roost-irc` flag, the
`--permission-mode` flag (with `--agent`, defers to the agent's native
`permissionMode:` frontmatter; with `--model`, smart-defaulted: `auto` for
fable, opus, and sonnet, `acceptEdits` for everything else (haiku, or any
unrecognized model); explicit `--permission-mode` wins either
way), and the dev-channels confirmation prompt that appears on first
launch.

Anything passed after `--` is forwarded verbatim to claude — use this
for `--chrome`, `--system-prompt`, `--thinking-display`, or any other
claude flag the wrapper doesn't otherwise know about.

## Spawnable agents (roost agents)

`roost spawn <nick> --agent NAME` runs a session as that named agent. `roost agents`
lists the `NAME`s available:

- **`roost agents`** — the agents installed here: what you can spawn right now.
- **`roost agents --all`** — also everything roost ships, flagging what isn't
  installed here yet and how to install it (`roost init --force-agents`). Use
  this to find a newly shipped agent.

## Multi-provider (--harness, --provider, --role)

`roost init` scaffolds two empty keys in `.orchestrator/config.json`:
`providers` (named provider entries: harness, model, and optionally
`base_url_env` / `auth_env` for an alternate backend) and `roles` (role
name to one or more provider names, in preference order). An operator
fills these in by hand. An empty registry is not an error. `roost spawn`
without `--provider` or `--role` works exactly as it does today.

`--provider NAME` picks one named provider directly. `--role NAME` picks
from that role's candidates. The two flags are mutually exclusive.

Provider resolution order: explicit `--harness`, `--model`, or `--agent`
always wins and skips the registry entirely. `--provider` resolves that
named provider directly. `--role` resolves through the roles map in
`.orchestrator/config.json`. No `--provider` and no `--role` means no
registry: today's behavior, claude harness with the opus default.

Cross-org rule: spawning a reviewer requires its provider org to differ
from the recorded worker org. The spawn fails when every candidate is
same-org. `--allow-same-org "<reason>"` overrides the rule and records
the reason. Any `--allow-same-org` override must be announced in
`#<project>-leads`.

The Codex harness is a stub in this release. Spawning `--harness codex`
(directly or via the registry) fails fast and names the follow-up
adapter work.

## IRC permission oversight (--perm-irc)

`--perm-irc` runs a permbot routing module inside the worker's MCP
process. It opens a second IRC connection on the stable nick
`permbot-{worker}` and serializes the worker's PermissionRequest
prompts as DMs to `--perm-target` (required). The operator replies
`y` / `n` / `yes` / `no` / `allow` / `deny` (case-insensitive); anything
else falls through to the regular terminal prompt as a safety net.
Permbot lifecycle is the MCP's lifecycle — `roost shutdown` reaps it
along with the worker.

Primary use case: an Opus orchestrator spawning a worker that isn't
running auto mode — haiku or an unrecognized model default to
`acceptEdits` (edits auto-approved; Bash and MCP still gate), or any
model can be held in `acceptEdits` via `--permission-mode` for oversight.
With `--perm-irc --perm-target <orchestrator>`, those remaining prompts
come to the orchestrator over IRC instead of blocking the terminal. Same
pattern works for a human at any roost-attached IRC client.

```bash
# Opus orchestrator gates a sonnet worker held in acceptEdits for oversight:
roost spawn worker-123-A -c '#pr-123' -m sonnet --permission-mode acceptEdits \
  --perm-irc --perm-target orchestrator

# Human operator gates a haiku worker (acceptEdits by default):
roost spawn scratch-h -c '#sandbox' -m haiku \
  --perm-irc --perm-target mynick
```

Worker prerequisite: the worker must have the roost plugin active.
`roost spawn --perm-irc` injects the `PermissionRequest` hook into
the spawned session via `--settings`; sessions without `--perm-irc`
do not have the hook loaded.

The hook auto-passes any `mcp__roost-irc__*` tool through without
asking — otherwise the worker couldn't talk on IRC, including replying
to its own approver.

To find permbot logs for a running session:

```bash
dir=$(tmux show-environment -t roost-<nick> ROOST_DATA_DIR | sed 's/ROOST_DATA_DIR=//')
cat "$dir/permbot.log"
```

The data dir is also printed by `roost spawn` as "data dir: ...".

## AskUserQuestion routing (--ask-irc)

Routes AskUserQuestion calls to a channel instead of blocking the terminal; pair with --ask-target (the nick whose replies count).

```bash
# The PM routes questions to the leads channel (human answers):
roost spawn myproject-pm --agent project-manager \
  --ask-irc '#myproject-leads' --ask-target <your-nick>

# APM routes questions to the leads channel (the PM answers):
roost spawn myproject-apm --agent associate-pm \
  --ask-irc '#myproject-leads' --ask-target myproject-pm
```

`--ask-target` defaults to `--perm-target` when both are set. See
`roost spawn --help` ("Agent class guidance") for the full role→flag heuristic.

## Prerequisites

Ergo must be running on `127.0.0.1:6667`. `roost status` checks;
`roost spawn` aborts with a hint if it's down. Start with:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/roost-ircd/logs && cd ~/roost-ircd
nohup ergo run --conf "$(roost root)/etc/ergo.yaml" > /tmp/ergo.out 2>&1 &
```

Stop with `pkill -f 'ergo run.*roost/etc/ergo.yaml'`.

## Naming conventions

Multiple projects can share one ergo. To avoid IRC nick + channel
collisions, every per-project nick + channel carries a project prefix
(the project's lowercase slug, matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`):

- **Standing agents** — stable nicks for long-lived roles. One instance
  per role. In a project: `<project>-pm`, `<project>-dispatcher`.
- **Per-issue workers** — `<project>-worker-<N>`, e.g. `myproj-worker-196`.
  Ephemeral; join their channel on assignment, leave on completion.
- **Per-issue reviewers** — `<project>-reviewer-<N>`, e.g. `myproj-reviewer-196`.
  Spawned at setup alongside the worker; resident until the issue merges.
- **Observers (ad-hoc)** — descriptive nicks (`ci-feed-monitor`, `metrics-A`).
- **Permbot routing connections** — `permbot-{worker}`, automatically
  named by `--perm-irc` (don't pick a worker nick that would collide
  with an existing `permbot-*` nick). These are second IRC
  connections opened by the worker's MCP process — not standalone
  daemons.

The prefix is for IRC nick uniqueness and GitHub comment attribution
when agents share one GH account. It is not an in-chat speaker label —
IRC nicks already show who said what.

Multi-repo mode (no top-level `config.repo`) inserts a `<slug>` segment
into every per-issue artifact: `#<project>-<slug>-issue-<N>`,
`<project>-<slug>-worker-<N>`, `<project>-<slug>-reviewer-<N>`. The slug
is the lowercased repo basename (`Owner/Foo` → `foo`). Cross-org name
overlap (`Org1/foo` + `Org2/foo`) is a known footgun. Single-repo mode
(with `config.repo` set) keeps the bare `<project>-issue-<N>` shape.

Ergo refuses nick collisions, so two agents trying the same nick
will fail. The wrapper doesn't enforce uniqueness for you — pick
nicks that won't collide with what's already on the server. Check
with `roost status` (which lists running tmux sessions).

## Channel conventions

- `#roost` — default landing channel. Cross-cutting only; no
  persistent per-PR worker traffic.
- `#<project>-leads` — per-project leads channel for project-scoped
  coordination. PM + APM + dispatcher live here.
- `#<project>-issue-<N>` — one per active issue. Created on first JOIN;
  dissolves when the last member leaves.
- `#sandbox` — ad-hoc testing / demos / one-off coordination.

## Lifecycle = channel membership

- Worker pickup = `roost spawn worker-NNN-X -c '#pr-NNN' --cwd <worktree>`.
- Hard restart = `roost shutdown worker-NNN-X`, then spawn fresh.
- Assignment end = shutdown when the work is merged.
- A worker leaving `#pr-NNN` (via shutdown or channel_leave) ends
  the assignment. See `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Common patterns

**Pick up a PR:**

```bash
roost spawn worker-123-A -c '#pr-123' --cwd ~/Dev/myproject
roost attach worker-123-A   # one-time prompt to bootstrap, then detach
```

**Coordinate via a shared channel:**

```bash
roost spawn reviewer-123 -c '#pr-123' --cwd ~/Dev/myproject
# worker-123-A and reviewer-123 now both on #pr-123
```

**See what's running:**

```bash
roost list
roost status
```

**Peek at a session's TUI without attaching:**

```bash
roost tail worker-123-A -n 50
```

**Tear down a session:**

```bash
roost shutdown worker-123-A
```

The bun MCP subprocess and the IRC connection close as part of the
tmux session teardown — no orphan processes.

## Diagnostics

If `roost spawn` hangs at the dev-channels prompt step, the prompt
text may have changed. Check the pane manually:

```bash
roost attach <nick>
# you may need to dismiss a prompt
```

If the session comes up but the agent never responds, the `roost-irc`
MCP probably failed to load. Check
`~/Library/Caches/claude-cli-nodejs/<project-dir>/mcp-logs-roost-irc/`
for the most recent JSONL log; common causes:

- `ROOST_IRC_NICK is required` — env var name typo (must be
  `ROOST_IRC_NICK`, not `ROOST_NICK`); the wrapper sets it correctly.
- Nick already in use — pick a different one.
- ergo down — `roost status` will say so; start it.
